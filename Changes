        + Add : m{send,recv} will croak() if any of their arguments is invalid.
        + Chg : The requirements to pass the speed test were lowered.
        + Doc : Typos in POD.
        + Fix : You can now send "0" as a valid message.
        + Fix : I lied, t/02-sigusr.t wasn't really gone.
        + Fix : while ($speed > 1) { $speed /= 2 } ok($speed >= 1); never fails.

0.04    2007-08-17 14:45 UTC
        + Add : Test for SUGUSR{1,2} in Makefile.PL.
        + Add : Unicode support. Enabled by passing utf8 => 1 to m{send,recv}.
        + Chg : The speed must now be passed to msend() by speed => $speed.
        + Chg : Tests no longer pass their result with pipes.
        + Doc : <apeiron>  Prof_Vince, 'truely' isn't a word.
        + Fix : t/11-speed.t didn't fail properly (as if those tests don't fail
                enough yet!).
        + Fix : t/02-sigusr.t didn't check properly the returned value.

        + Add : samples/bench.pl, a transfer speed benchmark script.
        + Add : New tests : t/02-sigusr.t, t/11-speed.t
