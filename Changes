        + Add : Test for SUGUSR{1,2} in Makefile.PL.
        + Add : Unicode support. Enabled by passing utf8 => 1 to m{send,recv}.
        + Chg : The speed must now be passed to msend() by speed => $speed.
        + Chg : Tests no longer pass their result with pipes.
        + Doc : <apeiron>  Prof_Vince, 'truely' isn't a word.
        + Fix : t/11-speed.t didn't fail properly (as if those tests don't fail
                enough yet!).
        + Rem : t/02-sigusr.t, as it just seems to fail everywhere.

0.03    2007-08-16 16:20 UTC
