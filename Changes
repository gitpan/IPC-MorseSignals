Revision history for IPC-MorseSignals

0.09    2008-02-03 18:25 UTC
        + Tst : Fix a race in child creation : the parent could send the message
                before the child was ready to receive it.
        + Tst : Turn autoflush on onto the reader end of the pipe.
        + Tst : Renamed IPCMTest to IPC::MorseSignals::TestSuite
        + Tst : Prefix author tests by 9*-.
        + Tst : New optional author test : 95-portability-files.t, that uses
                Test::Portability::Files when it's present.

0.08    2007-09-05 09:40 UTC
        + Chg : The sender detects now automatically if the message is encoded
                in UTF-8, thanks to Encode::is_utf8. You no longer need to pass
                the utf8 option to msend. The Encode module is a prerequisite.
        + Chg : Tests that used to die now report correct failure.
        + Fix : Tests are now strict.
        + Fix : Miscount in t/13-speed.t

0.07    2007-08-28 11:30 UTC
        + Chg : Common test code was factored into a module.
        + Chg : Tests were lightened again.
        + Doc : Typos in POD.

0.06    2007-08-21 08:15 UTC
        + Add : The protocol now carries the UTF-8 flag (hence you no longer
                need to specify it to mrecv()) and the sender's PID (but you can
                mask it).
        + Add : New functions : mreset(), mlastmsg(), mlastsender().
        + Chg : msend() accepts now the sign option, to specify is the sender
                can put its PID into the message packet or not (default is yes).
        + Chg : mrecv() now returns a hash reference that holds the receiver's
                state. %SIG has to be passed as the first argument. The callback
                is no longer mandatory and should be passed with the cb key. The
                utf8 key was removed.
        + Chg : The tests call fork() only one time.

0.05    2007-08-18 16:50 UTC
        + Add : m{send,recv} will croak() if any of their arguments is invalid.
        + Chg : The requirements to pass the speed test were lowered.
        + Doc : Typos in POD.
        + Fix : You can now send "0" as a valid message.
        + Fix : I lied, t/02-sigusr.t wasn't really gone.
        + Fix : while ($speed > 1) { $speed /= 2 } ok($speed >= 1); never fails.

0.04    2007-08-17 14:45 UTC
        + Add : Test for SUGUSR{1,2} in Makefile.PL.
        + Add : Unicode support. Enabled by passing utf8 => 1 to m{send,recv}.
        + Chg : The speed must now be passed to msend() by speed => $speed.
        + Chg : Tests no longer pass their result with pipes.
        + Doc : <apeiron>  Prof_Vince, 'truely' isn't a word.
        + Fix : t/11-speed.t didn't fail properly (as if those tests don't fail
                enough yet!).
        + Fix : t/02-sigusr.t didn't check properly the returned value.

0.03    2007-08-16 16:20 UTC
        + Chg : Better t/10-base.t... Or at least, I hope so.

0.02    2007-08-16 15:55 UTC
        + Add : samples/bench.pl, a transfer speed benchmark script.
        + Add : New tests : t/02-sigusr.t, t/11-speed.t
        + Fix : Warnings when the transfer fails.
	+ Doc : The protocol was documented.

0.01    2007-08-15 21:20 UTC
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
