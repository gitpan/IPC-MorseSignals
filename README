NAME
    IPC::MorseSignals - Communicate between processes with Morse signals.

VERSION
    Version 0.12

SYNOPSIS
        # In the sender process
        use IPC::MorseSignals::Emitter;

        my $deuce = new IPC::MorseSignals::Emitter speed => 1024;
        $deuce->post('HLAGH') for 1 .. 3;
        $deuce->send($pid);

        ...

        # In the receiver process
        use IPC::MorseSignals::Receiver;

        local %SIG;
        my $pants = new IPC::MorseSignals::Receiver \%SIG, done => sub {
         print STDERR "GOT $_[1]\n";
        };

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a rare form of IPC by sending Morse-like signals
    through "SIGUSR1" and "SIGUSR2". Both of those signals are used, so you
    won't be able to keep them for something else when you use this module.

    IPC::MorseSignals::Emitter is a base class for emitters ;
    IPC::MorseSignals::Receiver is a base class for receivers.

    But, seriously, use something else for your IPC. :)

DEPENDENCIES
    You need the complete Bit::MorseSignals distribution.

    Carp (standard since perl 5), POSIX (idem) and Time::HiRes (since perl
    5.7.3) are also required.

SEE ALSO
    IPC::MorseSignals::Emitter, IPC::MorseSignals::Receiver.

    Bit::MorseSignals, Bit::MorseSignals::Emitter,
    Bit::MorseSignals::Receiver.

    perlipc for information about signals in perl.

    For truly useful IPC, search for shared memory, pipes and semaphores.
