NAME
    IPC::MorseSignals - Communicate between processes with Morse signals.

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use IPC::MorseSignals qw/msend mrecv/;

        my $pid = fork;
        if (!defined $pid) {
         die "fork() failed: $!";
        } elsif ($pid == 0) {
         local @SIG{qw/USR1 USR2/} = mrecv sub { print STDERR "recieved $_[0]!\n" };
         1 while 1;
        }
        msend "hello!\n" => $pid;
        waitpid $pid, 0;

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a rare form of IPC by sending Morse-like signals
    through "SIGUSR1" and "SIGUSR2". It uses both signals "SIGUSR1" and
    "SIGUSR2", so you won't be able to keep them for something else when you
    use this module.

    But, seriously, use something else for your IPC. :)

FUNCTIONS
  "msend"
        msend $msg, $pid [, $speed ]

    Sends the string $msg to the process $pid (or to all the processes @$pid
    if $pid is an array ref) at $speed bits per second. Default speed is
    1000, don't set it too low or the target will miss bits and the whole
    message will be crippled.

  "mrecv"
        mrecv $callback

    Takes as its sole argument the callback triggered when a complete
    message is received, and returns two code references that should replace
    SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signal handlers. Basically, you want to use it like
    this :

        local @SIG{qw/USR1 USR2/} = mrecv sub { ... };

EXPORT
    This module exports on request its two only functions, "msend" and
    "mrecv".

DEPENDENCIES
    POSIX (standard since perl 5) and Time::HiRes (standard since perl
    5.7.3) are required.

SEE ALSO
    perlipc for information about signals.

    For truely useful IPC, search for shared memory, pipes and semaphores.
