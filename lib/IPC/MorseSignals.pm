IPC::MorseSignals - Communicate between processes with Morse signals.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # In the sender process
    use IPC::MorseSignals::Emitter;

    my $deuce = IPC::MorseSignals::Emitter->new(speed => 1024);
    $deuce->post('HLAGH') for 1 .. 3;
    $deuce->send($pid);

    ...

    # In the receiver process
    use IPC::MorseSignals::Receiver;

    local %SIG;
    my $pants = IPC::MorseSignals::Receiver->new(\%SIG, done => sub {
     print STDERR "GOT $_[1]\n";
    });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a rare form of IPC by sending Morse-like signals through C<SIGUSR1> and C<SIGUSR2>. Both of those signals are used, so you won't be able to keep them for something else when you use this module.

=over 4

=item L<IPC::MorseSignals::Emitter> is a base class for emitters ;

=item L<IPC::MorseSignals::Receiver> is a base class for receivers.

=back

But, seriously, use something else for your IPC. :)

=head1 CAVEATS

When the same signal is sent several times in a row to a process, the POSIX standard does not guarantee that the relevant signal handler will be called for each of the notifications.
This will result in malformed messages if the transfer speed is so high that the operating system does not have the time to call the signal handler for each bit.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

You need the complete L<Bit::MorseSignals> distribution.

L<Carp> (standard since perl 5), L<POSIX> (idem) and L<Time::HiRes> (since perl 5.7.3) are also required.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<IPC::MorseSignals::Emitter>, L<IPC::MorseSignals::Receiver>.

L<Bit::MorseSignals>, L<Bit::MorseSignals::Emitter>, L<Bit::MorseSignals::Receiver>.

L<perlipc> for information about signals in perl.

For truly useful IPC, search for shared memory, pipes and semaphores.
